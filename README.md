## Online Harassment Shield
UN SDG 5 highlights various challenges faced by women and girls all around the world. My solution aims to tackle the problem of women and girlâ€™s safety highlighted in goal 5.2 which talks about eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls.

Women often face lot of harassment through DMs and comments in social media. These messages can be in form of text, image, audio, and video, which impacts their mental and psychological health, and leaves them feeling helpless and vulnerable.

My solution is based on the logic that - The most effective way to safeguard from online hate is to minimize exposure. By ensuring that hateful messages are not visible in the first place, women can protect their mental and emotional well-being. 

This solution will analyze and categorize messages received in any format (text, image, audio and video), using multimodal model gemini-1.5-flash into 6 main categories-
1.	Verbal Abuse, Bullying and Mental Harassment
2.	Stalking and Doxing 
3.	Sexual Harassment
4.	Hate Speech and Discrimination
5.	Online grooming 
6.	Instigating violence and self-harm
   
If the message received was malicious, it will blur the content to the receiver. Receiver will have the option to View the message, Report the message and Get Help. If the message was categorized as non-malicious, it will be presented as is to the receiver.
